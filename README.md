# burger
A Burger App using heroku and a database server.
The user can do 3 things using this app:
    1. Make a new burger by typing its name into the "Make a New Burger" section at the bottom of the page.
    2. Eat a Burger.
        The number of times this burger has been eaten will increase by one, and it will move to the right side of the page.
    3. Remake an already eaten Burger.
        The burger will move to the "Available Burgers" section and can be eaten again. It will remain in the Burger history. 
        The "Make me again" option is only available for burgers that are not currently available.
